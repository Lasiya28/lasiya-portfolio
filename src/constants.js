  pc: `This is my PC. I usually like playing around with my Raspberry Pi and trying out different Linux distros but I've been experimenting a lot with AI and Large Language Models these days.  
      I've have professional experience being a QA Automation Engineer, Front-End and Back Developer... A bit of a chameleon ðŸ˜Ž. I've made some web projects, mostly using ReactJS for the front-end but I also like anything Python-related: Django back-end, automation, Web scraping, even have some certifications in Data Science. Anyway regardless of the language, I just wanna be able to build cool stuff.

  bed: `This is where I sleep. Great ideas comes when I'm lying on my bed. When an idea strikes, I often have to write it down or else I won't be able to sleep because my mental energy is consumed by it.`,
